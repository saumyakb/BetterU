The master branch is the prototype for submission on (11/22).

The branch wallpaperManager Works on changing the wallpaper at this point just using buttons. The next step is to change it based on th meal-times of the user.

The branch cvj_3  provides a user interface via an action bar to the application settings, including Participant ID, Notifications, Food Schedules and Preferences, Body Clock Rhythms.  Additionally, we have provided an action bar item to open up our daily web survey directly from our application.
